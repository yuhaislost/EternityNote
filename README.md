# Eternity - A Revolutionary Tool for your Success
A digital workspace inspired by Notion. This web application allows users to create efficient and organised nested notes with a pre-built block-based components typing system. Each note is customizable with its own title, image cover and icon. Users are able to archive and delete their notes as well as publish them to the internet for others to see. To ensure that each note is easily accessible, Eternity allows users to search for documents based on their name.

The purpose of this project was to explore and develop skills with new technologies such as Next.js 13, Convex, Clerk Auth, TypeScript and Shadcn-UI.
